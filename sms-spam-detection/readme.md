# SMS Spam Detection ðŸš«

This project is part of **INTERN ORBIT - 2 Month Internship (Level 2 Task)**.

---

##  Problem Statement

Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify SMS messages as **spam** or **legitimate**.

---

##  Goal

Utilize **TF-IDF** vectorization and machine learning algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, or **SVM** to process and analyze SMS text data. The objective is to identify spam messages based on learned patterns in textual content.

---

##  Skills Demonstrated

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Feature Engineering with TF-IDF
- Text Classification using ML algorithms
- Streamlit Web App Deployment
- Clean Code Organization (Modular Python structure)
