# Movie Rating Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the Level 1 task of the INTERN-ORBIT 2-month internship program. The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts movie ratings based on relevant input features.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict movie ratings using machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using a simple web interface.

## Task Description

This is a Level 1 task under the INTERN-ORBIT 2-month internship program. It focuses on implementing the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model for regression analysis. It demonstrates understanding of:

* Data loading and preprocessing

* Model training and evaluation

* Saving and loading models using joblib

* Building a basic front-end interface with Streamlit
